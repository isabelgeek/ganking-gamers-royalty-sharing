# GANKING APP

Here you will find the Ganking Trading dApp UI. 
Nice visually and interesting money generator/royalties for the Game Developer, the digital Item Creator (fans, agencies, gamers), and Players/Gamers.

## Setup
Once in the directory `ganking-app`, please run the following command in your terminal:

`yarn install`

Place the `json`files: GankingToken.json and GankingTraderApp.json that you got from the compilation and deployment in the `ganking-app-contracts` within the `build/contracts` folders.

Place the Contract Address and Transaction Hash from `GankingToken` and `GankingTraderApp` within GankintToken.js and GankingTraderApp.js and the abi information (you got it in `ganking-app-contracts`).

## Deploy
Run in your terminal the following command:

`npm start`

You can start to interact with the Gankind dApp locally.
