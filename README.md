# GANKING GAMERS ROYALTY SHARING

Focus on your Players? Gamers?
Ganking dApp converts them in a community of royalty sharing.

## Introduction

GANKING is not just about a marketplace of digital assets such as badges, videos, kudos, audios, or pictures.
It is about the Game developers, digital assets creators, professional gamers, their fans, and players seeing each other differently.

With Ganking, all of them are part of a community that curate and share assets, maintain integrity with incentives, and have a stake in the revenue from adding new members each time and asset is sold.

A royalty business model which is easy to manage with Ethereum and it is aimed to help game developers and players build a new recurring revenue stream.
It turns players into franchisers around exclusive digital assets.

It helps non-blockchain games and players to discover blockchain while making money.
Once they discover blockchain, it will be easier to reduce the reliance with centralised platforms.

## Players are your best Ad network

If our player enjoy and make money be sure they will be your best Ad network.
So why not decentralise value away from Ad networks with Ganking?


## Royalty Distribution Formula

Different royalty distributions can be done creating different incentives:
- Revenue to the Game Developer over time.
- Revenue to the digital asset/item Creator.
- Incentives for owners/players to keep transferring the token (adding more players/fans to the ecosystem) and not leaking the digital asset. This a community governance!
They are called Franchisors and it is a clear value propositon.
**With Ganking dApp loot boxes, in-app purchases, ads are no more the only money-maker**


## Setup

Please follow the setup in each folder/package:
- `ganking-tokens` - Discover and play with GANKING and SRNFT
- `ganking-app-contracts` - The business logic/backend
- `ganking-app` - The frontend


## Videos

In the `videos` directory you will find different videos of the flow.


## Demo App

For the purposes of the demo just only one token has been used and a video downloaded (digital item).

Currently the owner of the token is the address 0x8316BeE7CEFa899E0c6a192Eeb960331562a225c (an address managed by me).  
@OPGames team please ping me (through discordapp or Gitcoin chat) and I will list a price in ETH (Ropsten ETH) so you can purchase it and fully test/play with the dApp.


## A mechanism for non-blockchain games while educating the ecosystem with blockchain

- Ganking uses Metamask instead of Facebook Login.
- Ganking uses IPFS and Skynet (but also a CDN, sorry).
- Open source React for the frontend and smart contract sfor the backend.
- Instead of in-app purchases Ganking (GANKING) tokens and ETH.
